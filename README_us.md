# GitLab CI/CD Configuration

This project uses GitLab CI/CD for automating build, test, and deployment processes. Below is an overview of the configuration and how to set it up.

## Introduction

GitLab CI/CD automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code. It helps to ensure that the code in your project is always in a deployable state and that any issues can be detected early through automated tests.

## GitLab CI/CD Setup

To get started with GitLab CI/CD, you need to:
1. **Create a GitLab project** if you don’t have one yet.
2. **Add a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file** to the root of your repository. This file will define the steps of the CI/CD pipeline, such as building, testing, and deploying the application.
3. **Set up GitLab Runner** to execute the pipeline jobs.

## CI/CD Configuration File

The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file defines all stages, jobs, and scripts that GitLab will use to run CI/CD. Below is an example configuration:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  NODE_ENV: production

before_script:
  - npm install

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - npm run deploy
  only:
    - main
```
# GitLab CI/CD Pipeline Setup

This document explains the basic structure and setup for configuring GitLab CI/CD pipelines for your project.

## Example Explanation

### `stages`
Defines the stages that will be executed in your pipeline. Typical stages include:
- `build`: The process where your project is built.
- `test`: The stage where tests are run to ensure code quality.
- `deploy`: The stage where your project is deployed.

### `variables`
Defines environment variables that can be used throughout the pipeline. This can include values like API keys, version numbers, etc.

### `before_script`
A list of instructions that need to be executed before each job starts. Common examples include installing dependencies or setting up configurations.

### Jobs
Jobs represent specific tasks in the pipeline.

- **`build_job`**: The job where the build process occurs (e.g., compiling, bundling).
- **`test_job`**: The job where automated tests are run to ensure your code is working correctly.
- **`deploy_job`**: The job that deploys your application to the target environment (e.g., production, staging).

## GitLab Runner

GitLab Runner is a lightweight, multi-platform tool used to execute CI/CD jobs. Here’s how you can set it up:

### Install GitLab Runner
1. Install GitLab Runner on your system. For installation instructions, follow the official guide [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/).

### Registering GitLab Runner
To register the GitLab Runner for your project:

```bash
gitlab-runner register
```
# GitLab CI/CD Setup Guide

## Introduction

This guide will help you set up and monitor GitLab CI/CD pipelines for your project. Once configured, your pipelines will automatically run whenever you push changes to your repository.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that:

- You have a GitLab account.
- You have administrative access to your GitLab project.
- GitLab Runner is installed on your system.

## GitLab Runner Setup

### Registering GitLab Runner

1. You will be prompted for your **GitLab server URL** and **registration tokens**. These can be found in your GitLab project’s **Settings** > **CI / CD** > **Runners** section.
2. Choose the **executor**. The most common options are:
    - **Shell**: Runs commands in the shell environment.
    - **Docker**: Runs commands inside a Docker container.

Follow the GitLab documentation to register the GitLab Runner with your project.

## Monitoring Pipelines

Once you push your changes to GitLab, the CI/CD pipeline will automatically start. You can monitor the pipeline’s status in the following way:

1. **Go to your GitLab project page.**
2. **Navigate to the CI / CD section.**
3. You will see the status of the current pipeline (running, passed, failed).
4. Click on the pipeline to view detailed information about each job (build, test, deploy, etc.).

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline Failure

If your pipeline fails, check for the following potential issues:

- **Test Failures**: Ensure that all tests are passing and that the correct environment is being used.
- **Missing Dependencies**: Verify that all required dependencies are installed in your environment.
- **Incorrect Paths**: Check for issues with file or directory paths in your pipeline configuration.

### GitLab Runner Not Found

If you encounter an error saying that the GitLab Runner is not found, ensure that the runner is properly registered and running on your system.

### Permission Issues

Check if the GitLab Runner has the correct permissions to access the repository and the target environment. Make sure that the runner is running under an account that has the necessary permissions.
